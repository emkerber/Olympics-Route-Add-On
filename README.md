This was an assignment at Prime Digital Academy. Below are the instructions provided.

Olympics-Route-Add-On
For this add on, the client should be provided 5 buttons (one for each sport). When a given button is clicked, the random use generated by your server should be displayed in the ng-view (just as we did in class). Again the requirements should be the same as our previous app, just with the new addition of routes. Please push this code to a new repo with the name above.

Below are the instructions for the previos exercise.

Angular Challenge
ALL RIGHT! Set up a NEW project! From the ground up. Bring in Angular, that's all we will need for our project today.

Business Need:
We need a way to pick Olympic athletes for our new marketing campain. Make an application that has a Generate button that displays one athlete from 5 different sports of your choice. The chosen athletes should have their names and origins (locations) displayed. The athletes should be chosen at random, and should include all athletes competing in a given sport. Information on the athletes can be found here.

Technical Requirements
Our application will request 5 payloads from five different Express routes (one for each sport). All of the routes should exist inside of an Olympics.js router. The objects returned should follow this template:

{ Name: 'John Doe', Origin: 'New York, NY' }
